## Next Implementation Steps

### Priority 1: Essential Query Infrastructure

1. **SharePointTypeMappingSource** (`Storage/Internal/SharePointTypeMappingSource.cs`)
   - Map .NET types to SharePoint field types
   - Handle SharePoint-specific type conversions
   - Support for Text, Number, DateTime, Boolean, Lookup fields

2. **SharePointQuerySqlGenerator** (`Query/Internal/SharePointQuerySqlGenerator.cs`)
   - Translate SQL expressions to SharePoint REST OData queries
   - Handle SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, TOP, SKIP
   - Support for SharePoint-specific filtering

3. **SharePointSqlGenerationHelper** (`Storage/Internal/SharePointSqlGenerationHelper.cs`)
   - SharePoint-specific SQL generation utilities
   - REST API URL construction
   - OData query parameter handling

### Priority 2: Query Pipeline

4. **SharePointQueryCompilationContext** (`Query/Internal/SharePointQueryCompilationContext.cs`)
   - SharePoint-specific query compilation context
   - Integration with SharePoint metadata

5. **SharePointSqlTranslatingExpressionVisitor** (`Query/Internal/SharePointSqlTranslatingExpressionVisitor.cs`)
   - Translate LINQ expressions to SharePoint OData
   - Handle SharePoint field references
   - Support for SharePoint functions

6. **SharePointMethodCallTranslatorProvider** (`Query/Internal/SharePointMethodCallTranslatorProvider.cs`)
   - Translate .NET method calls to SharePoint operations
   - String methods, date functions, etc.

### Priority 3: Update Operations

7. **SharePointUpdateSqlGenerator** (`Update/Internal/SharePointUpdateSqlGenerator.cs`)
   - Generate SharePoint REST API calls for CUD operations
   - Handle list item creation, updates, deletions
   - Batch operation support

8. **SharePointModificationCommandBatch** (`Update/Internal/SharePointModificationCommandBatch.cs`)
   - Batch multiple operations for efficiency
   - SharePoint-specific batching constraints

### Priority 4: Database Operations

9. **SharePointDatabaseCreator** (`Storage/Internal/SharePointDatabaseCreator.cs`)
   - Create/check SharePoint lists
   - Site and list existence verification
   - Schema validation

10. **SharePointExecutionStrategy** (`SharePointExecutionStrategy.cs`)
    - Retry logic for SharePoint throttling
    - Handle transient failures
    - SharePoint-specific error handling

## Architecture Decisions Made

1. **REST API Over CSOM**: Using SharePoint REST API instead of CSOM for broader compatibility and easier deployment.

2. **No Traditional Migrations**: SharePoint has limited schema modification capabilities, so traditional EF migrations are not fully supported.

3. **List-as-Table Mapping**: SharePoint lists are treated as database tables with limited relational capabilities.

4. **OData Translation**: LINQ queries are translated to OData REST queries rather than traditional SQL.

5. **HTTP Client Abstraction**: Using HttpClient with proper disposal and configuration for SharePoint authentication.

## Known Limitations (By Design)

1. **No Complex Joins**: SharePoint doesn't support complex relational operations
2. **Limited Transactions**: SharePoint doesn't support traditional database transactions
3. **Schema Constraints**: Limited ability to modify SharePoint list schemas
4. **Performance**: REST API calls are inherently slower than direct database access
5. **Authentication**: Requires SharePoint-specific authentication mechanisms

## Testing Strategy

1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components in isolation
2. **Integration Tests**: Test against actual SharePoint Online instances
3. **Performance Tests**: Validate query performance with large lists
4. **Authentication Tests**: Verify different authentication flows

## Dependencies

- **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore**: Core EF functionality
- **Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Relational**: Relational provider base classes
- **System.Net.Http**: HTTP client for REST API calls
- **System.Text.Json**: JSON serialization for API requests/responses

## Deployment Considerations

1. **Authentication Setup**: Client credentials or user authentication configuration
2. **SharePoint Permissions**: Appropriate list read/write permissions
3. **Network Connectivity**: Ability to reach SharePoint Online endpoints
4. **Throttling Handling**: Respect SharePoint API limits

## Future Enhancements

1. **PnP Core SDK Integration**: Optional integration for advanced scenarios
2. **CAML Query Support**: Alternative to REST for complex queries
3. **Lookup Field Support**: Better handling of SharePoint lookup relationships
4. **File Attachment Support**: Handle SharePoint list attachments
5. **Workflow Integration**: Support for SharePoint workflows and approvals

This implementation provides a solid foundation for using Entity Framework Core with SharePoint lists, following EF Core provider patterns and architectural best practices.
